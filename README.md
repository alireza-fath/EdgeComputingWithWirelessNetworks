# Purpose
This repository is created to make available the data and source code related to the expierments conducted in "GPR sensing and visual mapping through 4G-LTE, 5G, Wi-Fi HaLow, and Wi-Fi hotspots with edge computing and AR Representation". 

## Structure
The experiments described were conducted using a client server model using various connection methods, namely HaLow, 2.4 and 5GHz wifi, and 4G and 5G cellular. For all tests the scripts clienttest3 and servertest3 were used to generate the data. Data for the local connection methods described in section 3.2 are found in the LocalNetworkLatencyTestData directory. Data for the cellular connections methods described in section 3.3 are found in the CellularLatencyTestByPacketSize directory.
